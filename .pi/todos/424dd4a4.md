## Spec

- Scaffold a new Obsidian plugin project (package.json, tsconfig, manifest.json, main.ts, styles.css)
- Settings tab: target folder path, expiry duration in days (default 30), trash vs permanent delete toggle
- On layout ready: scan the configured folder, compare file stat.ctime against the threshold, and call app.vault.trash() on expired notes
- Add a ribbon icon to manually trigger cleanup
- Add a command palette entry: 'Delete expired notes now'
- Status bar item showing count of notes expiring within 3 days
- Use TypeScript, follow Obsidian plugin sample conventions
- Build should work with 'npm run build'
- Write a README.md with install/usage instructions
